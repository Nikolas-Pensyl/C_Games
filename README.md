# C_Games

This project is written in C++ utilizing the Qt Libraries and Qt IDE. All written by Nikolas Pensyl.

This a continual project I work on when I get the chance. Therefore this project will not be completed. With that in mind I accept applications for games to be included in this project any ideas that I think would be a good addition I will add. I am currently working on the Atari Breakout Game, but because I am in college I have to work on lots of homework making this more of a summer project. 

This project currently has Chess and Minesweeper working with Atari Breakout in development.
